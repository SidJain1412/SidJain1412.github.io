At every single waterfall or trek that you have been on, there have been a few people as smart and confident as you that have overestimated themselves and underestimated nature.

On a recent trek to Irshalgad, I came across a group of 12-15 people with 1 trek leader, they had camped the night and were going to the top of Irshalgad, which comes after a tricky section involving ropes and ladders. All of them looked unprepared, (crocs, converse shoes, shorts, etc.). For many, it was their first ever trek. 

How many of them do you think noticed the deserted, destroyed village of Irshalwadi that they just walked past? ([*29 villagers killed in Irshalwadi landslide*](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66264958)) Or were aware of the very experienced trekker who lost his life in the valley below after slipping on the tricky section they were about to attempt? ([*64-yr-old man on **200th trek** falls 350ft at Irshalgad Fort*](http://toi.in/N06JVZ/a24gk))

I *love* it when people go for treks and appreciate the beauty of the Sahyadris, but people need to be responsible and very few understand the risks, specially when they go in a big group full of people like them. I know that thousands of people trek without incident, but with the increasing number of reels showing people the beauty of the mountains and the simultaneous increase in unregulated trekking groups, I can't help but think of how easily things can go wrong.

Inexperienced trekkers are not at fault as much as the trek leaders who don't insist on safety and preparedness. And even then, people need to understand the intrinsic risk of what they're doing and respect the fact that things can go wrong very suddenly.

Please don't take that shortcut that saves you 3 steps.
