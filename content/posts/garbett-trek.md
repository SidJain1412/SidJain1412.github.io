A relatively easy (but long) trek near Karjat, just 90 minutes from Mumbai and a great weekend getaway

I highly recommend it, so would quite a few folks at CleverTap

Map above has many comments

### 🗺️ How To Reach:

- <b>Train:</b>

Local train from Ghatkopar to Bhivpuri Road (CSMT→Karjat Fast Train), takes ~90 minutes

- <b>Car:</b>

Drive to Diksal village, park near Shiv Temple (marked on the map) and descend back to there post the trek. Would not recommend since this would be ~30k steps, route on the map is easier and more pleasant.

### Tips/ Notes:

- Route shown in the map is about 23000 steps (~15km)
- Couple of risky bits in monsoon near the top, but manageable even with beginners
- Waterfall on the way to Sagachiwadi is only during monsoons, and it is relatively small but still very fun
- Medium crowd on Sunday mornings, yet to see a big group doing this trek
- Local train after 6:30AM will be crowded

### 🍜 What can I eat?

- Bhivpuri Road station has a vada pav stall nearby (post 7AM)
- Diskal village has general stores and small breakfast spots
- If you go around monsoon/ winter weekends, you will find a few maggi stalls
    - These stalls have water, biscuits, even tea etc.
