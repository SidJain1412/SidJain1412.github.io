<p>At every single waterfall or trek that you have been on, there have been a few people as smart and confident as you that have overestimated themselves and underestimated nature.</p>
<p>On a recent trek to Irshalgad, I came across a group of 12-15 people with 1 trek leader, they had camped the night and were going to the top of Irshalgad, which comes after a tricky section involving ropes and ladders. All of them looked unprepared, (crocs, converse shoes, shorts, etc.). For many, it was their first ever trek.</p>
<p>How many of them do you think noticed the deserted, destroyed village of Irshalwadi that they just walked past? (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66264958" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>29 villagers killed in Irshalwadi landslide</em></a>) Or were aware of the very experienced trekker who lost his life in the valley below after slipping on the tricky section they were about to attempt? (<a href="http://toi.in/N06JVZ/a24gk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>64-yr-old man on <strong>200th trek</strong> falls 350ft at Irshalgad Fort</em></a>)</p>
<p>I <em>love</em> it when people go for treks and appreciate the beauty of the Sahyadris, but people need to be responsible and very few understand the risks, specially when they go in a big group full of people like them. I know that thousands of people trek without incident, but with the increasing number of reels showing people the beauty of the mountains and the simultaneous increase in unregulated trekking groups, I can&rsquo;t help but think of how easily things can go wrong.</p>
<p>Inexperienced trekkers are not at fault as much as the trek leaders who don&rsquo;t insist on safety and preparedness. And even then, people need to understand the intrinsic risk of what they&rsquo;re doing and respect the fact that things can go wrong very suddenly.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t take that shortcut that saves you 3 steps.
