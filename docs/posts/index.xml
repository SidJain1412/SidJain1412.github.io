      <description>Man dies after 120 foot jump in Dabhosa waterfall
4 students drown near Sondai Fort, Experienced trekker dies in rapelling expedition in Ahmednagar
At every single waterfall or trek that you have been on, there have been a few people as smart and confident as you that have overestimated themselves and underestimated nature.

Just so y&amp;#39;all know:
